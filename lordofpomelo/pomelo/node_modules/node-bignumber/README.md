node-bignumber
===============

A pure JavaScript implementation of large-integer math, capable of performing useful-sized (512-bit, 1024-bit) 
RSA encryption. Packaged to also be used in a node environment. 

This library is a packaging of the original code from Tom Wu. The original files are available in the
original/ folder or on his [site](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/).

Updated for the 1.2 release as well as the 1.3 release of [jsrsasign](https://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign).

This Fork
---------
Native Node hashing algorithms are used in place of the original pure JavaScript ones.
Buffers are used as input and output instead of strings.  Still need to convert to Buffers all the way through.

Install
-------

Using NPM, installing is as easy as:
    npm install node-bignumber

Usage
-----

For help on using this in node.js, have a look at the tests. Here is a simple example on
how to generate a new key and use it to encrypt/decrypt a message.

    var rsa = require("bigint");
    var key = new rsa.Key();

    var message = "All your bases are belong to us.";
    console.log("Message:\n"+message+"\n");

    // Generate a key
    key.generate(1024, "10001");
    console.log("Key:\n");
    console.log("n:" + key.n.toString(16));
    console.log("e:" + key.e.toString(16));
    console.log("d:" + key.d.toString(16));
    console.log("\n");

    // Encrypt
    var encrypted = key.encrypt(message);
    console.log("Encrypted:\n" + rsa.linebrk(encrypted, 64) + "\n" );

    // Decrypt
    var decrypted = key.decrypt(encrypted);
    console.log("Decrypted:" + rsa.linebrk(decrypted, 64) + "\n");
